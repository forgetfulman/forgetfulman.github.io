  <h1>Reflections on GildedRose</h1>
  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2017-05-04T11:00:00+01:00" itemprop="datePublished">May 4, 2017</time></p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my <a href="https://github.com/forgetfulman/GildedRose/tree/making-good-method-reflection">latest take</a> 
on a solution to this problem I looked into the Java Reflections framework, something I have 
seen used effectively in production applications for simplifying the addition of new components.</p>

<p>For this approach I created the concept of an Assessor - the Gilded Rose Inn passes an 
Item to the Assessor, which evaluates and updates the Item’s quality.</p>

<p>The Assessor uses an ageing profile to evaluate an Item’s quality. The profile is a collection 
of ageing phases - an ageing phase is an association between the “sell in” counter and a quality 
change rate.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The Assessor uses a different reflected method from a profile class (ItemAgeingProfile) to 
determine an Item’s ageing profile. This method populates the ageing phase collection with 
the necessary phases to implement the new ageing algorithm.</p>

<p>The ageing phase is implemented as a class (AgeingPhase) the “sell in” counter and quality change 
rate as properties. The collection of ageing phases is implemented as a First Class Collection 
i.e. a class that understands how the ageing phases can be manipulated. This collection (ItemAgeingPhaseCollection) 
is populated via a reflected method.</p>

<p>To support a new Item type with a new ageing profile the only change is to drop a new (appropriately 
annotated) method into the ItemAgeingProfile class. Job done.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Using reflection to create a framework supporting new Item ageing profiles appears sound. 
Yet the use of method reflection is not optimal.</p>

<p>The most obvious limitation is that supporting many Item types becomes unwieldy. The ItemAgeingProfile 
class growing too large with added ageing methods.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>A further experiment would be to replace method reflection with class reflection. This addresses 
ItemAgeingProfile class size with Ageing profiles algorithms implemented as new classes.</p>

<p>The Item class also needs work - it feels more appropriate for the Item to handle its own ageing, 
even if the Assessor selects the appropriate profile.</p>

<p>It would also be a challenge to implement a further Calisthenics rule and restrict the Item class
to two properties.</p>
