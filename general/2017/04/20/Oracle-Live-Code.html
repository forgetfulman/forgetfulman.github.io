  <h1>Oracle Live for the Code London 2017</h1>
  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2017-04-20T11:00:00+01:00" itemprop="datePublished">Apr 20, 2017</time></p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Oracle Live for the Code was a developer focused event, taking place at Code Node in London 
and featuring 20 talks across the day.</p>

<p>These talks centered around some common themes:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>* Oracle's Bare Metal cloud offering
* New features of Java 9
* Tools and platforms for Microservices
* Using Docker for Microservice deployment
* Using Events to co-ordinate Microservices
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="oracles-bare-metal-cloud">Oracle’s Bare Metal Cloud</h2>
<p>Deepak Patil, Oracle Vice President Product Development, showcased the company’s “Data Center 
of the Future”. The emphasis of the talk, and a sentiment repeated through the day, was to 
free of developers to concentrate on development. The role of cloud service providers is to 
take care of the network and server infrastructure.</p>

<p>Deepak and Ubuntu’s Marks Shuttleworth highlighted the strength of Oracle Cloud’s network abstraction 
layer. This provides scalable clusters for organisations, duplicated at the L3 network layer. 
Any two network nodes can communicate at full bandwidth within the Oracle cloud. The upshot 
is a performant cloud infrastructure with repeatable, scriptable deployments.</p>

<h2 id="tools-and-platforms-for-microservice-deployment">Tools and Platforms for Microservice Deployment</h2>
<p>Having a cutting edge data center with scalable service means little without the tools for deployment.
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> was the tool of the day, demonstrated in the <a href="https://youtu.be/Y2GuI8Fl43A">technical keynote</a> 
and used as the basis for several of the microservice technical talks.</p>

<h2 id="using-events-to-co-ordinate-microservices">Using Events to Co-ordinate Microservices</h2>
<p>Microservices can pave the way for scaleable, performant services. In an enterprise environment 
microservices are often carved from legacy monolith applications. Business processes are likely 
to rely on these microservices interacting. The goal is for asynchronous interaction, preventing 
resurrection of the monolith with tight-coupling.</p>

<p>More than one speaker presented Event Bus solutions, highlighting <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>
 in particular.</p>

<p>Applications publish and subscribe to Event Bus streams. When an application does something 
of note it sends an event to the Bus. Subscribing applications receive a notification from 
the relevant Event Bus stream. The upshot is that a publishing application can fire and forget 
an event, without having to wait around for a receipt confirmation from a listening system.</p>

<h2 id="new-features-of-java-9">New features of Java 9</h2>
<p>Two talks presented new features of Java 9. The following topics generated more discussion.</p>

<h3 id="modules-project-jigsaw">Modules (Project Jigsaw)</h3>
<p>After 10 years in the making modules will be making an appearance. Vaunted as a rescuer from
class-path hell the general feeling was that they are not yet fully baked. Tight coupling
between modules with this language release seems to create the potential for more problems
than they solve. Something to watch in Java 10 once the kinks are ironed out.</p>

<h3 id="jlink">Jlink</h3>
<p>This provides the potential for delivering customised JRE, tailored to deliver only as much
as your project requires. This should lead to smaller software stacks and the delivery of
leaner microservices.</p>

<h3 id="class-multi-versioning">Class Multi-versioning</h3>
<p>Probably a really bad idea, this feature will allow the bundling of multiple class versions 
within a package to support different JRE version. My initial take was that this would be 
recipe for disaster and introduce a complicating factor in defect analysis.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/9PFcTwRlASY?t=1456">What’s Cool in Java 8, and New in Java 9</a> 
Oracle presentation provides more detail.</p>
